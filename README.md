# Scientific_Computing
We are a **Special Interest Group (SIG)** of **Puget Sound Programming Python meetup** (PuPPy - https://www.meetup.com/PSPPython/). We tentatively meet every Third-Thursday. Our meetings are informal, where speakers present/demonstrate on a topic. We emphasize lively discussions after each talk/demonstration. Our goal is to teach and learn from others.


## Organizers of this SIG:<br>
**Sai S. Nudurupati** (meetup profile: https://www.meetup.com/members/189071684/); <br>
**Kurt Maurer** (meetup profile: https://www.meetup.com/PSPPython/members/186155114/); and <br>
**Amanda Manaster** (meetup profile: https://www.meetup.com/PSPPython/members/256934194/). <br>


**PuPPy's Code Of Conduct (CoC - https://www.pspython.com/pages/code-of-conduct/)**  applies to our meetups. If you face an issue, please report to either a Scientific_Computing meetup's organizer (Sai, Kurt, and Amanda) or any of the PuPPy's organizers. Please be nice to each other and have fun.
