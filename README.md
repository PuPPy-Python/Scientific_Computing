# Scientific_Computing
We are a Special Interest Group (SIG) of Puget Sound Programming Python meetup (PuPPy - https://www.meetup.com/PSPPython/). We tentatively meet every Third-Thursday. Our meetings are informal, where speakers present/demonstrate on a topic. We emphasize lively discussions after each talk/demonstration. Our goal is to teach and learn from others.

PuPPy's Code Of Conduct (CoC) applies to our meetups. If you face an issue, please report to either a Scientific_Computing meetup's organizer (Sai or Kurt) or any of the PuPPy's organizers. Please be nice to each other and have fun.
